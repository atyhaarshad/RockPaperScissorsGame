<h2>Rock Paper Scissors game!</h2>

<p>This is how to play ..

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (rock crushes scissors, but will lose to one who has played paper (paper covers rock); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (scissors cuts paper). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied!</p>
